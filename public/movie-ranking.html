<h1>The Best Movies According to Diana</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Cloud Atlas</h3>
<ul>
    <li>The actors/actresses play multiple characters with prosthetics and special makeup effects.</li>
    <li>I refuse to believe the original plot.</li>
    <li>This movie made my list because it is too philosophical to pass.</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Lord of the Rings Trilogy</h3>
<ul>
    <li>If I can binge-watch these movies in one sitting, I'm winning in life.</li>
    <li>These movies take you on such a long journey that you can't help to find solutions for Frodo to get rid of the Ring faster. How about those eagle, anyone...?</li>
</ul>

<h3>Pride and Prejudice</h3>
<ul>
    <li>This is my ultimate comfort movie that I always watch once a year.</li>
    <li>The musical scores in this film is the soundtrack to my life if it had one.</li>
    <li>I love an epic romantic speech.</li>
